// Complexity:
// O(1) time and O(1) space

// Problems:
// We can't delete the last node with this method. We can, however, set the last node's value to null and and treat it as a dead node
// or a sentinel node. The trade-off, though, is that we can't have non-dead nodes with values set to null.
// Thus, we will throw an error instead.
//
// Side Effects:
// 1. If we have a pointer to b somewhere else in our code and we were assuming it still had its old value, then we'd have bugs.
// 2. If we have a pointer to c, and change the value of c, we will never be able to access that value via a traversal of our linked list.
